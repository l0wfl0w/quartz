# Now
I am currently working with [ARRI](https://www.arri.com/en), responsible for R&D strategy & roadmaps. 
Sometimes I write Essays on Design and Technology for [FORM](https://form.de) and others (see the latest one **here**). I am an active member of the [Near Future Laboratory](https://www.nearfuturelaboratory.com) Community.

Things I did before:
- designing and shipping high-end Cinema Cameras and equipment [for ARRI](https://britishcinematographer.co.uk/arri-awarded-with-a-technology-engineering-emmy-for-the-arri-multicam-system/)
- leading innovation consulting projects for clients in the fields of Energy Supply, Space Tech, Medical, FMCG
- designing shiny things like remote-controlled bicycle locks, medical robots, e-bikes, milk bottles, solar charging stations and many more
- founded [Klasse3h](https://www.marian-arnd.de/tagebuch/) artists collective with [Christian BÃ¤r](https://christianbaer.net), [Johannes Listewnik](https://johannes-listewnik.de) and [Clemens Rothbauer](https://www.clemensrothbauer.de/html/). We produced bespoke murals, paintings and zines for 10 years.
- designed a mechanical drawing robot that is controlled by the trees moving in the wind
